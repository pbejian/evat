# evat module for Python

This is a little funny module for Python.
The file evat.py is the main module and example.py is just an example of use.

## Usage

Just copy the two files evat.py and example.py in the **same** directory.
Do **not** open and look at evat.py, otherwise it's not so funny.
Run example.py and enjoy...
